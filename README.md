## Technologies / Libraries Used 

- [JavaJRE] - used to run Java platform applications; 
- [Scene Builder] - generates FXML, an XML-based markup language that enables users to define an application's user interface, separately from the application logic;
- [JavaFX] - java-based multimedia software platform for creating and making rich Internet applications available;
- [RichTextFX] - provides a text area for JavaFX with API to style ranges of text. It is intended as a base for rich-text editors and code editors with syntax highlighting.

## How to run by terminal 
```
cd /dist
java -jar pavo.jar
```
