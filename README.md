## Features (Functionalities)
### - Lexica Analysis:
- Token identification of programs with syntax similar to the C programming language ;
- Personalized error messages.
### - General:
- Import .txt files to editor
- Dark mode. 

## Technologies / Libraries Used 

- [JavaJRE] - used to run Java platform applications 
- [Scene Builder] - generates FXML, an XML-based markup language that enables users to define an application's user interface, separately from the application logic.
- [JavaFX] - java-based multimedia software platform for creating and making rich Internet applications available.

## Accepted Tokens 

Below the list of tokens accepted by the lexical analysis.

| Expressions | Token Type | Expressions| Token Type |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------
| [a-z] or [A-Z] | letter | < | relational operator less |
| [0-9] | digit | >= | relational operator more equal |
| digit+ | int |<= | relational operator less equal |
| digit+.digit+ | float | ! | relational operator not |
| 'letter' | char | != | relational operator not equal |
| "anything" | char sequence | == | relational operator equal |
| + | arithmetic operator plus |( or ) | special character parentheses |
| - | arithmetic operator minus | { or } | special character braces |
| * | arithmetic operator multiplication| [ or ] | special character brackets |
| ^ | arithmetic operator power | # | special character hash |         
| / | arithmetic operator division | , | special character comma |          
| = | arithmetic operator assign | ; | special character semicolon |       
| > | relational operator more | : | special character two points |
