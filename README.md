> Status do Projeto: Em desenvolvimento :warning:

## Features (Functionalities)
### - Lexica Analysis:
- Token identification of programs with syntax similar to the C programming language ;
- Personalized error messages.
### - General:
- Import .txt files to editor
- Dark mode. 

## Technologies / Libraries Used 

- [JavaJRE] - used to run Java platform applications 
- [Scene Builder] - generates FXML, an XML-based markup language that enables users to define an application's user interface, separately from the application logic.
- [JavaFX] - java-based multimedia software platform for creating and making rich Internet applications available.

## Accepted Tokens 

Below the list of tokens accepted by the lexical analysis.

| Expressions | Token Type | Expressions| Token Type |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------
| [a-z] or [A-Z] | letter |  >= | relational operator _ |
| [0-9] | digit | <= | relational operator _ |
| digit+ | int | ! | relational operator not |
| digit+.digit+ | float | != | relational operator not equal |
| 'letter' | char | == | relational operator equal |
| "[anyCharacter]*"| string | ( or ) | special character _ |
| . | punctuation | { or } | special character _ |
| + | arithmetic operator plus | [ or ] | special character _ |
| - | arithmetic operator minus | # | special character hash |
| * | arithmetic operator multiplication | , | special character _ |
| ^ | arithmetic operator power | ; | special character _ |
| / | arithmetic operator division | : | special character _ |
| = | arithmetic operator assign |
| > | relational operator _ |
| < | relational operator _ |
