## Features (Functionalities)
### - Lexical Analysis:
- Token identification of programs with syntax similar to the C programming language;
- Personalized error messages.
### - General:
- Import .txt files to editor;
- Dark mode. 

## Technologies / Libraries Used 

- [JavaJRE] - used to run Java platform applications; 
- [Scene Builder] - generates FXML, an XML-based markup language that enables users to define an application's user interface, separately from the application logic;
- [JavaFX] - java-based multimedia software platform for creating and making rich Internet applications available;
- [RichTextFX] - provides a text area for JavaFX with API to style ranges of text. It is intended as a base for rich-text editors and code editors with syntax highlighting.

## Accepted Tokens 

Below the list of tokens accepted by the lexical analysis.

| Expressions | Token Type | Expressions| Token Type |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------
| [a-z] or [A-Z]  | letter | <= | relational operator less equal|
| [0-9] | digit | ! | relational operator not |
| digit+ | int | != | relational operator not equal |
| digit+.digit+ | float | == | relational operator equal | 
| 'letter' | char | ( | special character parentheses open |
| "anything" | char sequence | ) | special character parentheses closed |
| + | arithmetic operator plus | { | special character braces open |
| - | arithmetic operator minus | } | special character braces closed |
| * | arithmetic operator multiplication| [ | special character brackets open |
| ^ | arithmetic operator power | ] | special character brackets closed |     
| / | arithmetic operator division | # | special character hash |           
| = | arithmetic operator assign | , | special character comma |   

| > | relational operator more | ; | special character semicolon |     
| < | relational operator less | : | special character two points |
| >= | relational operator more equal | & | special character address |
